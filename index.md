# Structured Monolith

Welcome to structured monoliths!

### Mission

We think that developers can build system very efficient software systems by using a monolithic approach. 

### Why

In past times, artificial physical separation of responsibilities was the only known way to architects to keep chaos in bay.

### How does it work?

Structured monoliths are build upon sophisticated architectural validation frameworks (AVF) ensure that developers don't shot themselves into the foot. Due to AVFs, logical separation of reponsibilites is the mean to structure a software system.
